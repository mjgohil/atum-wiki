# Project Editing

![UI](/dashboard/img/Project_editing_UI.png)

The above picture is the UI for editing a project. A project:
- Is a collection of constructs
- Has a default codon table that is used to default the codon table of its constructs  

Using the tools in the project editing menu you can:  
- Create Constructs
- Create Elements
- Search through the projects sequences
- &#x45;xport sequences as fasta files 
- Back-translate Amino Acid elements
- Do simple cloning

{/* Had to escape the E because export is a key word */}

### Construct List

This list of all the constructs in the current project. Each construct can be expanded to show their elements. Constructs can be reordered, edited and deleted
and more from this list. Learn more about the constructs [here](./constructs.mdx).

### Element List

Lists all the elements within a construct.
- Reorder elements by dragging
- Copy elements using the context menu
- Delete elements
- Multiselect elements to create groups
  - Use shift key to select multiple elements
- Change color
- Edit sequence

### Construct Element Tools

1. Add  
This tool window is where you find things that can be added to new constructs
2. Edit  
This tool window gives many options to edit elements. Learn more about the edit tools [here].

### Scroll Panes

The Project editor has 3 levels of scrolling used to navigate through the selected construct. Learn more about the scroll panes and navigating
through constructs [here].

### Sequence Pane

The Sequence Pane shows the sequence position and either codons or translation frames. Using the scroll panes you can navigate through your constructs
to find the elements or sequence you are looking for. The sequence pane allows you too:
- Highlight sequences and perform actions on them
- Use the search tools to search for motifs, Restriction sites, orfs and repeats
- annotate sections of the sequence
- change the codon table the construct is using
- And more

### Project Tools and Links

The links in this menu are:
- Home: Returns to the home menu where you will find you project dashboard and other admin tools
- [Quick Export]: this tool allows you to export your constructs and/or elements as fasta
- [Cloning tool]: A tool that allows to clone constructs and elements to create a new construct with the result
- [Backtranslate]: A simple backtranslation tool to automatically select codons for a given Amino Acid element
- Help: A tool to get help with the project editor
