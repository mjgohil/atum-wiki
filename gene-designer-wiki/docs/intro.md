# Gene Designer

GeneDesigner is a powerful software tool used in molecular biology research, specifically for designing and manipulating DNA sequences.

- Design DNA sequences by assembling smaller functional elements.
- Backtranslate amino acid sequences
  - using codon frequencies for your expression host
  - removing unwanted motifs (restriction sites, ribosome binding sites, splice sites etc)
  - adding convenient silent restriction sites
- Perform computational cloning
<!-- Design oligonucleotides for sequencing, mutagenesis and PCR amplification -->
and much moreâ€¦

## Getting Started
On first login after accepting the terms and conditions, you'll be present with project dashboard.

### Projects page
![UI](/dashboard/img/project-page-initial.png)

This is your basic folder based navigation containing all your projects.  The Demo project is added for you to get familiar viewing.  Double click to view the construct.

If you want to see your own constructs, drag in (fasta, gdx) to add to your project space.

### Project construct page
![UI](/dashboard/img/demo-construct.png)

Here you have your project Demo with 1 construct called FP-04-411.  You have 3 basic navigation zones.
1. Construct navigation of full construct
2. Element navigation for finer detail
3. Sequence navigation for fine grain sequence nagivation

One thing to note is that this Demo project is view only indicated by the icon to the left of "DEMO" which only allows for navigation.  We'll go over edit capabilities in our editing tutorial [Project Editing](./project-editing/project-editing-ui.mdx).
